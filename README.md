# Phishing Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the detection of phishing websites using various machine learning techniques, particularly XGBoost for classification.

The notebook walks through the entire process, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation, and threshold optimization for improving the classification performance.

## Installation
To run the notebook, ensure you have Python 3.x installed, along with the required libraries. You can install all dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or install the necessary libraries manually:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib
```

## Dataset
The notebook uses a dataset that includes features extracted from URLs to determine whether they are phishing or legitimate websites.

You can download or use your own dataset for training and testing.

- **Number of Features**: Multiple features such as URL length, domain length, and others that contribute to phishing detection.
- **Label**: The target column that classifies whether a URL is phishing (1) or non-phishing (0).

## Features
The key features of this notebook include:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- **Feature Engineering**: New feature creation and selection of relevant features.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Using `GridSearchCV` to fine-tune the XGBoost model.
- **Threshold Optimization**: Optimizing the classification threshold to maximize the F1-score.
- **Model Evaluation**: Performance evaluation using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, as well as visualizing confusion matrices.

## Usage
To use the notebook, simply run it in any Jupyter environment. You can follow the steps outlined in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

Run the notebook with:

```bash
jupyter notebook phishing.ipynb
```

## Model Evaluation
The notebook provides an evaluation of the model's performance based on various metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, along with a confusion matrix visualization.
